**Purpose**  
Enforce baseline quality, readability, and accessibility across the codebase using the **Significa Foundations** library (no external UI kits).

**Core Principles**
- Prefer **composition over configuration**. Small primitives + named slots.
- Use **CVA (class-variance-authority)** or equivalent variant logic _only if present in Foundations_. If not present, implement minimal, typed variant helpers per component.
- **Accessibility-first**: roles, labels, focus outline, keyboard flows.
- **Strict TypeScript** for all public APIs and events.
- Keep components **pure** when possible; keep side-effects in hooks.

**Styling & Tokens**
- Use **OKLCH** or design tokens provided by Foundations; avoid ad‑hoc hex.
- Tokens are the single source of truth. Never hardcode palette values.
- Respect **WCAG AA** contrast as a minimum.

**Testing & Docs**
- Provide unit tests for logic-heavy parts.
- Every component must ship an example and notes for edge cases.

**Diff Etiquette**
- Small, focused diffs; include rationale + a11y notes.
