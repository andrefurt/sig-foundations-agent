**Assumptions**
- TypeScript as the primary language.
- Tailwind or tokenized CSS variables **only if present in this repo**; else stick to Foundations' styles approach.
- No external component kits; **Foundations is the design system**.

**File Organization**
- Co-locate component, styles, tests, and examples in the same folder.
- Export a stable API from an `index.ts` per component folder.

**Accessibility**
- Radix-like semantics are fine if the repo uses them; otherwise use native semantics + ARIA attributes as required.
