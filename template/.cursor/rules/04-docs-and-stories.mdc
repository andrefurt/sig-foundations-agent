# rule: Documentation & Examples
type: always
scope: **/*
---
Every exported component must include **documentation** with:

- **Description**: What the component does and when to use it.
- **Anatomy**: Structure and slots.
- **Props**: Typed API with defaults and constraints.
- **States**: hover/focus/active/disabled/loading/invalid.
- **Accessibility**: roles, labels, keyboard interactions.
- **Usage Examples**: basic, with slots, edge cases (long text, truncation).
- **Do/Don't**: practical guidance.
- **Changelog**: meaningful changes impacting usage.

Prefer Markdown colocated in `.cursor/rules/components/*.mdc` so the agent can ingest it directly.
